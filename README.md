# RANK-OF-A-MATRIX
## Aim:
To write a python program to find the rank of a matrix
## Equipment’s required:
1. 	Hardware – PCs
2. 	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
## Algorithm:
## Step 1: Import required library
Use NumPy, which has built-in functions for matrix operations.

## Step 2: Define the matrix
Enter the matrix whose rank is to be found.

## Step 3: Use rank function
Apply numpy.linalg.matrix_rank() to compute the rank.

## Step 4: Display the result
Print the rank of the matrix.

#Program to find the rank of a matrix.

import numpy as np
a = np.array( [[1,2,3],[3,6,9]])
solution  = np.linalg.matrix_rank(a)
print(solution)

## Output:
